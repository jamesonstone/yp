# Ruleset: safety-guardrails

## Purpose

- Define always-on safety checks for repository, GitHub, and git operations.
- Run before work-lane decisions or PR delivery workflow.
- Prevent primary-checkout edits, unsafe writes, identity mistakes,
  protected-branch mutations, blind retries, and unauthorized deletion.

## Applies When

- Always active before any coding-agent repository, GitHub, or git mutation,
  regardless of PR consent.
- Runs first, before `work-lane-gating`.
- Applies before assessing lane, branch, import-graph, or PR workflow questions.

## Rules

### Execution Order

1. Run read-only `safety-guardrails` recon and identity checks.
2. Obtain and record the explicit `work-lane-gating` choice.
3. Record the complete Pull-Request Landing Plan.
4. Establish or verify the non-primary writable worktree.
5. Run `github-pr-delivery` only inside that lane.

Do not evaluate lane or import-graph questions before recon completes. The current branch scope cannot be assessed without knowing the branch.

### Canonical Authority Model

Use this matrix instead of inventing an authority boundary in each workflow:

| Action | Required authority |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only discovery | Implied by the task |
| In-scope implementation and safe recovery | Current accepted task |
| Issue, branch, commit, push, and ready PR | PR-delivery consent |
| Review-thread mutation | Explicitly assigned repair/resolution authority |
| PR merge | Direct merge request or accepted bounded merge plan |
| Multi-repository merge program | Approved plan plus reconciled program ledger |
| Deployment or infrastructure mutation | Applicable infrastructure/deployment approval |
| Protection bypass, admin override, identity substitution | Prohibited |

- Authority is bounded by repository, target, action, intended effect, actor,
  and applicable environment. Revalidation and compatible retries preserve an
  unchanged authority boundary; material scope expansion requires follow-up
  authorization.
- PR-delivery consent, automatic lane allocation, subagent assignment, check
  success, and program-ledger existence never imply merge authority.
- Before an authorized merge, resolve the `pull-request-merge` workflow and
  follow `github-pr-merge`.

### Prohibited Actions

GitHub access is never permission to:

- Merge without a direct request or accepted bounded merge plan.
- Force-push protected branches.
- Delete branches.
- Change repository settings.
- Change secrets.
- Bypass review.
- Alter protected branch rules.

### Working-Tree Recon

Run before anything and show output:

```bash
pwd
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git worktree list --porcelain
CURRENT_BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --state all --json number,url,state,isDraft,headRefName,baseRefName,assignees
```

- Identify current branch, default/base branch, repository owner/name, and the
  exact primary checkout.
- Identify active pull requests for the current branch before editing, committing, pushing, or mutating any PR.
- Confirm the active directory, branch, remote, and PR head branch match the intended work lane.
- Repeat this recon after thread resumes, user redirects, branch changes, or any sign that another thread may have moved the work forward.
- If the active branch, remote, or PR state does not match the expected issue branch or repository, resolve the mismatch autonomously when the intended lane can be proven safely; otherwise report the ambiguity and request the smallest input needed before mutating.
- If `gh` is unavailable, use an approved GitHub connector for the active PR lookup; if neither is available, report that the active PR check could not run before mutating.
- Do not overwrite, revert, or mix unrelated user changes.
- If unrelated dirty files exist, leave them alone.
- If dirty files overlap the requested work, preserve them and resolve the overlap autonomously when ownership and intent are evident; otherwise complete unblocked work and request the smallest clarification needed without discarding changes.
- Work in the existing checkout only when it is the exact non-primary worktree
  that owns the user-selected writable lane.
- When the current checkout contains unrelated work or another active lane, preserve it and use a separate canonical worktree rather than switching, stashing, resetting, cleaning, or mixing branches.

### Worktree Lane Selection

- Canonical linked worktrees live only at `~/worktrees/<owner>/<repository>/<lane>`, outside every repository checkout.
- Before creating a worktree, inspect `git worktree list --porcelain` and reuse the exact registered branch worktree when one exists.
- Use exact uppercase `GH-<number>` for a durable issue branch lane.
- Use exact uppercase `PR-<number>` only for a temporary detached pull-request view. Never implement or repair in that detached view; reuse the pull request's writable head branch worktree.
- Keep one active branch in one worktree. Do not bypass Git's branch ownership check.
- Treat working files, the index, and `HEAD` as worktree-local. Treat objects, refs, remotes, most configuration, and stash entries as shared clone state.
- Never create linked worktrees inside a project directory, including `.worktrees/`.
- Treat the exact primary/root checkout as read-only for coding-agent work,
  even when it is clean, on a feature branch, or has a pull-request plan. Do
  not edit files, generate artifacts, stage, commit, or switch branches there.
- Perform every repository mutation directly in the user-selected non-primary
  durable worktree. Never edit the primary checkout with a plan to move the
  diff later.
- Use native `git worktree` commands and ordinary filesystem operations as the portable authority. Rules and reconciled guidance must not require `git-wt`, an alias, plugin, or other wrapper.
- For a writable lane, link the clone's primary checkout repository-root `.env` and `.envrc` by default when each source exists. Create only exact symlinks after proving the destinations do not exist, or accept already-matching symlinks during reuse; omit both links when isolation is required.
- Never copy environment contents or overwrite destination environment material. Preserve a repository- or user-supplied `.envrc`; because `.envrc` is executable shell configuration, review the primary source and retain path-specific direnv approval.
- Keep detached `PR-<number>` views environment-isolated, and preserve existing files and links during migration without creating new ones.
- Never use stash, reset, clean, force removal, branch deletion, or substring-based target selection to make a worktree operation succeed.
- List worktrees without pruning. Prune only through an explicit prune action after reviewing stale metadata.
- Remove only an exact registered path after proving it is not the current checkout, contains no tracked, untracked, or ignored material other than verified expected `.env` and `.envrc` symlinks, and has no unpushed commits. Verify that each link targets the matching primary-checkout source, unlink only those symlinks before ordinary non-force `git worktree remove`, and restore them if removal fails.
- Keep runtime services, databases, ports, Temporal state, process supervision, and sibling-repository orchestration outside the worktree workflow.
- Subagents may use only a worktree explicitly prepared and assigned by the supervisor. They may not independently create, switch, move, or remove worktrees.
- Load `docs/references/worktrees.md` for command usage and the complete mental model.

### Protected-Branch Detection

Treat these branch names as protected by assumption, case-insensitively, pending verification:

```text
main, master, develop, dev, production, prod, prd, staging, stage, stg
```

Verify actual protection before any write that could touch one:

```bash
# requires authenticated gh; CURRENT_BRANCH and BASE_BRANCH from recon
for b in "$CURRENT_BRANCH" "$BASE_BRANCH"; do
  if gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/$b/protection" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "PROTECTED (verified): $b"
  else
    case " main master develop dev production prod prd staging stage stg " in
      *" $(echo "$b" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') "*) echo "PROTECTED (assumed; could not verify): $b" ;;
      *) echo "unverified, not in assumed set: $b" ;;
    esac
  fi
done
```

- If a target branch is protected, verified or assumed, never commit to it, force-push it, or delete it. Branch off it instead.
- If `gh` cannot verify and the branch is in the assumed set, fail closed and treat it as protected.
- Treat the discovered base branch as protected by default.

### Secret Scanning

- Before staging, verify no secrets, credentials, `.env` files, local tokens, private keys, or machine-local config were added accidentally.

### Git Author Identity

- The human user must be the git author and committer for every commit.
- Never use an agent, bot, tool, or autogenerated identity as author or committer.
- Inspect before committing and show output:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
```

- If identity is missing, ambiguous, or not the human user's, stop and ask.
- Never fall back to a default, tool, bot, or agent identity.
- Do not change global git config unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer per-commit or repo-local config when a config change is needed.

### Autonomous Failure Recovery

Agents own the requested outcome. On a lint, test, template, tool, authentication, state, push, or other workflow failure:

1. Capture the exact error and current state.
2. Diagnose the cause with read-only inspection before another mutation.
3. Preserve the authorized repository, target, scope, intended effect, and human identity.
4. Choose a safe compatible recovery path, retry autonomously, and verify the resulting state.
5. Continue until the goal is complete or a genuine external blocker remains.

- A failed tool or connector does not revoke authorization for the same intended mutation. Use another supported authenticated path, including `gh`, without asking the user to reply with retry permission when repository, target, scope, intended effect, and human identity are unchanged.
- Do not blindly repeat the same failed command. Retry only after diagnosis or a material change in evidence, state, parameters, or tool path.
- Do not use `--force`, `--force-with-lease`, `git rebase`, `git reset --hard`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, an amend to an already-pushed commit, or branch/issue/PR recreation as a recovery shortcut.
- Missing credentials, ambiguous identity or target, conflicting user-owned changes, unavailable external dependencies, or required external authorization are genuine blockers. Complete unblocked work, report the evidence, and request only the smallest missing input; do not frame this as permission for a routine retry.
- Autonomous recovery never supplies a missing work-lane choice, Pull-Request
  Landing Plan, or exact ownership proof. Preserve ungated and primary-checkout
  changes under the work-lane tripwire instead of staging, committing, pushing,
  discarding, or silently transferring them.

### Permission Boundary

- Resolve all in-scope implementation, validation, and delivery issues autonomously and continue until the requested goal is fully complete or a genuine external blocker remains.
- The explicit work-lane choice is a mandatory permission boundary. Obtain it
  before any repository file or delivery mutation; do not infer it from the
  general instruction to complete the task.
- Follow `deletion-safety` before designing deletion behavior or deleting
  persistent project, user, business, or external-system state. Default to
  soft delete and obtain post-outline specific manual confirmation for the
  exact current targets before every hard delete.
- Honor explicit repo-local approval gates. For covered public-cloud, Kubernetes, or infrastructure-as-code mutations, follow `infrastructure-change-approval` before mutation; use one plan-level confirmation per complete batch, then execute that batch and compatible retries without re-prompting; consolidate additional required changes into one follow-up batch, and always obtain post-outline confirmation for deletion or removal.
- Outside explicit repo-local approval gates, ask permission only before large-scale deletion or deleting sensitive files.
- Before requesting hard-delete confirmation, resolve the exact targets, scope,
  sensitivity, cascades, and recoverability with read-only inspection. An
  unqualified deletion request never authorizes irreversible purge.
- This permission boundary does not authorize actions prohibited above. Never ask for permission to bypass protected branches, review, identity, secret, force-push, merge-authorization, or repository-setting safeguards.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not commit directly to a protected or assumed-protected branch.
- Do not clean up a failure with destructive git commands.
- Do not hide unrelated dirty work inside the requested change.
- Do not put worktrees inside repositories, improvise flat paths outside the project hierarchy, edit detached `PR-<number>` views, or force worktree cleanup.
- Do not stage secrets, `.env` files, tokens, private keys, or machine-local config.
- Do not proceed to lane gating before branch and repository recon is complete.
- Do not mutate the primary checkout or use it as a temporary edit location.
- Do not infer the user's lane choice from clean state, current branch, issue
  references, or a generic request for a pull request.
- Do not commit when author or committer identity is missing, ambiguous, or not the human user's.
- Do not ask the user to authorize a compatible `gh` or connector retry that preserves the already-authorized mutation.
- Do not treat autonomous failure recovery as permission to bypass an explicit infrastructure-change approval gate.
- Do not blindly repeat a failed mutation without new evidence or a revised recovery path.
- Do not perform large-scale deletion or delete sensitive files without explicit permission.
- Do not hard-delete covered state without the exact post-outline manual
  confirmation required by `deletion-safety`.
- Do not treat delivery consent, agent assignment, successful checks, or a
  program ledger as authority to merge.

## Verification

- Confirm `pwd`, `git status --short --branch`, `git remote -v`, and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` were run and shown.
- Confirm current branch, default/base branch, and repository owner/name were identified.
- Confirm `git worktree list --porcelain` identified the exact primary checkout
  and intended writable worktree.
- Confirm active PRs for the current branch were checked, or that an unavailable PR lookup was explicitly reported before mutation.
- Confirm the active directory, branch, remote, and PR state matched the intended work lane before editing, committing, pushing, or mutating a PR.
- Confirm the explicit lane choice and complete Pull-Request Landing Plan were
  recorded before any repository file or delivery mutation.
- Confirm the primary checkout received no coding-agent file, index, commit, or
  branch mutation.
- Confirm protected or assumed-protected branches were not written to.
- Confirm overlapping dirty files were preserved and either resolved safely from evidence or reported as a genuine blocker without destructive cleanup.
- Confirm every separate lane reused or created the exact `~/worktrees/<owner>/<repository>/<lane>` path, and that no nested worktree or duplicate branch checkout was created.
- Confirm detached `PR-<number>` views remained inspection-only and writable repairs used the pull request head branch.
- Confirm writable lanes linked only the expected `.env` and `.envrc` sources by default or intentionally omitted both links for isolation, preserved existing destination material, and did not copy environment contents, stash, reset, clean, force-remove, delete a branch, or discard tracked, untracked, ignored, or unpushed state.
- Confirm author and committer identity were inspected before any commit.
- Confirm secret scanning happened before staging.
- Confirm routine failures were diagnosed, recovered autonomously, and verified, or that a genuine blocker was reported with the smallest required user input.
- Confirm compatible authenticated tool-path changes did not trigger routine permission requests.
- Confirm explicit repo-local approval gates were satisfied before their covered mutations.
- Confirm large-scale deletion and sensitive-file deletion did not occur without explicit permission.
- Confirm covered deletion defaulted to a recoverable lifecycle and every hard
  delete had exact, current, post-outline manual confirmation.
- Before any merge, confirm a direct request or accepted bounded plan created
  authority for the exact PR set and `pull-request-merge` resolved without a
  required evidence gap.

## Examples

Working-tree recon:

```bash
pwd
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
CURRENT_BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --state all --json number,url,state,isDraft,headRefName,baseRefName,assignees
```

Git identity inspection:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
```

Compatible GitHub recovery:

```text
The connector PR mutation failed, but repository, branch, PR intent, and human identity are unchanged.
Re-run read-only PR and authentication checks, use authenticated gh for the same mutation, and verify the resulting PR state without asking the user to authorize the retry.
```
