# Workflow: Release Orchestration

## Purpose

- Turn bounded repository scope into a dependency-aware Global Release Graph and exact authorized merge plan.
- Keep merge, hosted workflow, deployment, runtime, production, and integrated-system evidence separate.

## Applicability Boundaries

- Load infrastructure approval only for nodes that can mutate public-cloud, Kubernetes, or infrastructure-as-code state, including merges known to trigger those mutations.
- Load agent-team topology only when work safely separates into bounded lanes.
- Create or adopt a cross-repository program ledger only when the existing coordination trigger applies: multiple repositories plus dependent deliverables, staged deployment or activation, or expected agent/session handoff.

## Phases

1. Discover the bounded release set, repository policy, identities, dependencies, runtime relationships, deployment effects, and verification ownership without mutation.
2. Construct the Global Release Graph and bounded merge plan; record the authorization source and exact approved PR set before any merge.
3. Remediate review, conflict, compatibility, migration, and validation blockers through repository-owned delivery lanes.
4. Resolve `pull-request-merge`, recompute the current authorized `MERGE_READY` frontier, and execute only dependency-safe merge and deployment waves.
5. Verify the exact merged and deployed identities, runtime behavior, and final integrated system; preserve partial, blocked, unknown, and intentionally open state literally.

## Completion Gates

- Every merged or queued PR belonged to the exact authorized set and current ready frontier.
- Every deployment or infrastructure effect had applicable target, impact, recovery, approval, and post-change evidence.
- Corrective PRs and newly discovered targets received authority before merge.
- Merge success was never substituted for hosted workflow, deployment, runtime, production, or integrated-system proof.
