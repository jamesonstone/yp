# Workflow: PR Feedback Repair

## Purpose

- Preserve the supervisor contract produced by `kit pr fix` without Kit launching an agent.
- Repair only current, verified findings on the exact same-repository PR-head branch.

## Phases

1. Use `kit pr fix` for bounded current feedback intake and lane evidence.
2. Record an Agent Team Plan before spawning; use at most three independent low-overlap lanes, never more than four, and serialize shared files.
3. Verify every finding against current HEAD and fix only still-valid issues.
4. Run complete validation and a read-only verification lane after nontrivial repair.
5. Review the full integrated diff, push one coherent batch, verify the exact remote head, reflect, then explicitly resolve only addressed threads.

## Completion Gates

- The writable lane, expected head, push target, and dirty-change ownership are explicit.
- Stale, false-positive, out-of-scope, and human-needed findings are reported rather than silently changed.
- Kit itself did not edit source, stage, commit, push, comment, resolve, or merge from the prompt-producing path.
